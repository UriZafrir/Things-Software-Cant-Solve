# Things Software Can't Solve

  
### Water contamination
* [2.1 billion people lack safe drinking water at home, more than twice as many lack safe sanitation](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2017-2-1-billion-people-lack-safe-drinking-water-at-home-more-than-twice-as-many-lack-safe-sanitation)
* Due to pollution, poverty, and inadequate resource management, around 2.1 billion people lack access to safe drinking water.
* Annually, 297,000 children under the age of five die from diarrheal infections caused by poor sanitation, hygiene, or contaminated drinking water.
* 80% of wastewater is discharged into the environment without being processed or reused
### Non-Renewable Resources Will Eventually Run Out
* Fossil Fuels - petroleum, coal, natural gas
* [Water - Global fresh water demand will outstrip supply by 40% by 2030](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/17/global-fresh-water-demand-outstrip-supply-by-2030)

### [Pollution](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/pollution)
* Air pollution
    - [Almost all of the global population (99%) are exposed to air pollution levels that put them at increased risk for diseases including heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer and pneumonia](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution#:~:text=Almost%20all%20of%20the%20global,pulmonary%20disease%2C%20cancer%20and%20pneumonia.)
* Water Pollution
    - [Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces. Microbial contamination of drinking-water as a result of contamination with faeces poses the greatest risk to drinking-water safety](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water#:~:text=Contaminated%20water%20and%20poor%20sanitation,individuals%20to%20preventable%20health%20risks.)    
* Land Pollution
    - [Third of Earth's soil is acutely degraded due to agriculture](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/12/third-of-earths-soil-acutely-degraded-due-to-agriculture-study)
### Micronutritient Deficiency

    - [Report - Scarcity of micronutrients in soil, feed, food, and mineral reserves - Urgency and policy options - Report and advisory memorandum for the Dutch Minister of Agriculture and Foreign Trade (2012)](./PDFs/scarcity_of_micronutrients.pdf)
* [Our crops are not as nutritious as they used to be](https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment-and-conservation/2022/05/fruits-and-vegetables-are-less-nutritious-than-they-used-to-be)
* [More than 2 billion people in the world today are estimated to be deficient in key vitamins and minerals](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/WHO-WFP-UNICEF-statement-micronutrients-deficiencies-emergency#:~:text=Deficiencies%20of%20micronutrients%20are%20a,%2C%20iodine%2C%20iron%20and%20zinc.)
* [Example - 92% of the U.S. population has vitamin deficiency](https://thebiostation.com/bioblog/do-you-have-vitamin-deficiency/)
### Global Hunger
### Gender Inequality
* [ Women still have only three quarters of the legal rights afforded to men , around 2.4 billion women of working age are not afforded equal economic opportunity and 178 countries maintain legal barriers that prevent their full economic participation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/03/01/nearly-2-4-billion-women-globally-don-t-have-same-economic-rights-as-men)

### Wars
* People have an intrinsic need for power and that is not going to change anytime soon.
### Overpopulation
### Wealth Inequality
* [Money wants to make more money. This is why rich countries are getting more investments than poor countries.](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/global-capital-flows--how-poor-countries-finance-the-rich/47007494)
